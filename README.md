AFLPs

This repository contains various scripts for scoring and analyzing AFLP data for population genetic analysis.

Most of the processing functions are in AFLP_replicate_analysis.py

The initial data entry is done independently by two people. compare_2_files.py can then be used to report differences. compare_otu_names.py can be used to compare names in different files. After processing, output can be converted to genAlex using convert_to_genAlex.py.
